== Support for Dynamic Timeslots (TCH/F, TCH/H, PDCH)

OsmoBTS supports dynamic switchover of timeslots between different physical
channel configurations, initiated by the BSC via (non-standard) Abis messages
-- see the _OsmoBTS Abis Protocol Specification_ <<osmobts-abis-spec>>.

The Abis message handling for dynamic timeslots is independent of the BTS
model. However, dynamic switchover will only work for BTS models that implement
the internal API to reconnect a timeslot (_bts_model_ts_disconnect()_ and
_bts_model_ts_connect()_).  Currently, these BTS models support dynamic
timeslots:

* _osmo-bts-sysmo_
* _osmo-bts-litecell15_
* _osmo-bts-trx_
